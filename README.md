These 2 Sudoku solvers are based on two methods namely:
1) Hidden/Naked Singles
2) Dancing Links

Both these codes work for any grid sizes 4x4 till 25x25. To work with larger grids, you'd need to write your own method to attach meaning to certain characters in the input so that it can have a corresponding numerical values.

I hope my code helps broaden your understanding on these two methods of solving Sudoku puzzles. Enjoy!
