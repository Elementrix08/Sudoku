These 2 Sudoku solvers are based on two methods namely:
1) Hidden/Naked Singles
2) Dancing Links

Both these codes work for any grid sizes 4x4 till 25x25. To work with larger grids, you'd need to write your own method to attach values to certain characters.

I hope my code and comments helps broaden your understanding on these two methods of solving Sudoku puzzles. Enjoy!

Credit for Dancing Links goes out to Donald E. Knuth for coming up with this beautiful method.
